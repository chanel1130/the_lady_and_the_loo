      <div class="description">
        <p>One time, I was in a movie theatre with my two friends. Before the movie started, we went to the toilet. There was a queue of around four to five people in front of the women’s toilet, while it seemed empty next door. One of my friends and I went for the queue. The other friend came late, and when she saw us, she shrugged her shoulder, “hey, the men’s toilet is empty. We should go.” A few eyes fell on her while she waited for us to respond. The friend with me didn’t say anything and just turned her head away with a smile. I was a little swayed by her idea, and just when I decided to go with her, the queue moved. I was suddenly not sure how I would feel about those looks. “It’s ok. You can go.” She came out when we were still waiting.</p>
        <p>Maybe I am too familiar with the feeling, and I sometimes just forget that it exists. I was waiting in front of the toilet, crossing my arms, bearing the smell, when some guy came out, hands in his pocket, whistling; I was in a tourist attraction, regretting that I had drank too much water when spotting the crowd around the women’s toilet; The cry of babies, the humid air, the way that the women in front of and behind me stay close with me that makes me feel like we are sardines in a can. These things consist of my memory around the women’s toilet.</p>
        <p>My female family and friends don’t really talk about it, except for grumblings during the wait. It is not like that we feel embarrassed about it, but rather we have never been given an opportunity to bring it up. It always seems too trivial, not important enough to be discussed in a serious way. Afterall, it is not even a permanent issue for anyone. It only happens from time to time. But it happens.</p>
        <p>Maybe it is time to finally ask the question: why there is oftentimes a long queue in front of the women’s toilets? We are going to dig into the issue with data and analysis, in the hope of finding a better solution to the design of future toilets and the reconstruction of the existing ones. </p>

        <p>In a survey conducted by the UK government, more than half of the female respondents say that they “very
          often” or “quite often” have to queue to use toilets in public spaces, while that only speaks true to 11% of
          the male respondents. The reasons behind vary. From a biological perspective, females averagely have a
          longer peeing period. At any time, among the females of menstruating age, there will usually be around 25 %
          of them on their period. It takes a longer time for them to clean up and change tampons or pads, and the
          fact that a lot of toilets don’t have menstrual disposals has made it even more difficult for them.
          Pregnancy reduces the bladder capacity, which requires frequent trips for those who have given childbirth.

    <div class="description1">
      <p>Even more reasons reveal to have nothing to do with the biological constraints that women face, but rather the design of public toilets and social customs. The primary reason why women wait longer than men is that the net number of toilets for women is smaller than that for men, as a toilet cubicle inevitably takes up more space than a urinal. An average toilet area can accommodate 20% to 30% more toilets for men (urinals + cubicles) than for women. In addition, it is predominantly women who take care of and guard babies and young children when using the public toilets, which takes them double or even more of the time. One thing that can be easily ignored yet noteworthy is that women usually have more clothes to remove, and they are more likely to carry bags, adding to the space use and vulnerability. </p>

      <p>Potty Parity, or restroom equity, refers to the allocation of public toilet facilities to accommodate equal wait times for men and women. Originating in the 1980s, it is aimed at addressing the disproportionate number of women's toilets compared to men's in public spaces. Using simulations of a busy period, an ideal toilet ratio for men and women has been raised to 1:2 in favor of women to reduce queues, which has been achieved in over twenty states in the US. What about the other side of the ocean?</p>

      <p>In the main cities in mainland China, toilet provision has been taken seriously, with all of them shown in the graph surpassing the 1:1 ratio. Among the cities, Guangzhou has done better than its peers, reaching 1:1.79, while the average ratio stays at 1:1.52, which indicates that a consistent effort needs to be made to better accommodate women’s toilet needs. Taiwan is far ahead with a ratio of 1:3, well above the international average. 
        The inequality in the promotion of Potty Parity has shown the level of importance that different areas have attached to women’s dilemma in public toilets, and to gap the difference in the awareness and emphasis can be the next step in the coming decade.</p>

      <p>In recent years, the call for gender-neutral toilets has been growing fast for multiple reasons. Gender-segregated toilets has reinforced binary gender identities, and a growing non-binary and transgender group has been asking for toilets that welcome all genders to avoid inconvenience and harassment. Gender-neutral toilets can also help guardians with children or the disabled of a different gender avoid misunderstanding. More concerning to our topic, gender-neutral facilities would cut down waiting times for women. Based on a study at Ghent University in 2017, moving to gender-neutral toilets may reduce waiting times for women from 6 minutes to less than a minute and a half.

      <p>Based on the graph, around half of the respondents are in favor of gender-segregated toilets, higher than those who advocate having both or having only gender-neutral toilets. On a gender basis, women are more prone to having both gender-segregated toilets and gender-neutral toilets than men are, indicating that the potential benefits that gender-neutral toilets may bring to social justice and gender issues are more aware of by women. However, during the past five years, the opinions have been going back and forth and didn’t have a leap or main change, which might have to do with the not-that-inclusive design of gender-neutral toilets and the concerns around them.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <p>In 2016, the Barbican Centre in London experimented with gender-neutral toilet provision, yet it led to quite some confusion and frustration among some users. Basically, the men’s toilet was changed to “gender-neutral with urinals” and women’s toilets was changed to “gender-neutral with cubicles”. However, a lot of female users rejected using toilets with urinals, and the practice in a sense increased the wait time for women as more men than women felt comfortable using both facilities. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>In a sense, the construction of gender-neutral toilets should not to merely converting gender-segregate toilets to gender-neutral, which seems to be a quick fix to the queueing issues while not the case in reality. Study has shown that a gender-neutral facility without urinals would still reduce queue length for women yet it would impose on wait times for those who could otherwise use urinals. 
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>The emergence gender-neutral has been seen by some as a loss of women’s safe space. The public toilet is oftentimes viewed as a safe space for women to rest, to talk, and to fix their make-up away from “the male gaze”, while now they have to share the space. The privacy and security issues brought by gender-neutral toilets have been a central concern. Without specific crime data, it is difficult to predict whether a gender-segregated or gender-neutral facility is any more or less of a threat to cis- or trans- women. However, the protection of vulnerability and surveillance of the surrounding have to be taken into consideration when designing a gender-neutral facility.

      <p>“A woman would never design the bathroom this way,” said Taumya Loveli Banks, author of Toilet as a Feminist Issue, “if more women were industrial designers, we might have bathrooms designed to accommodate equal numbers of men and women and stalls designed for women's comfort and convenience.” In the data, we have seen progress and setbacks in the design and redesign of public toilets. The queue length for women has been reduced through the enlargement of the toilet space and the construction of gender-neutral toilets. However, the ideal ratio of men’s and women ‘toilets has not yet been achieved by a lot of areas, and the inclusivity and privacy issues of gender-neutral toilets are waiting for a more considerate design. The fairest solution should always be a mix of options (a co-existence of gender-segregated toilets and gender-neutral toilets) and the option to choose female-only should be retained.

      <p>There are in fact many more issues around public toilets, such as accessibility and hygiene that haven’t been touched upon by the research yet needs much more attention than they currently have. Public toilets can be a door between the private and the public, and how they are designed may shape one’s sense of belonging in the environment they live in.
